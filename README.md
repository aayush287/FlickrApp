# FlickrApp
An app allows user to see pictures from flickr website. This app uses Flickr Api to show user pictures from [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/)
website. It parses JSON responses from the API which are loaded through __AsyncTask__ class which runs in background without blocking <br>
main UI thread. It uses __Picasso__ library to load image from given URL.

## Why this project?
To become an Android developer, you must know how to bring particular mobile experiences to life. Specifically, you need to know how 
to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile 
devices. You will hone these fundamental skills in this project.

By building this app, you will demonstrate your understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android.<br>
Your app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.

## What I learned?

   - I fetched data from the Internet with Flickr API.
   - I used adapters and RecyclerView to populate list views.
   - I incorporated libraries to simplify the amount of code i need to write.
